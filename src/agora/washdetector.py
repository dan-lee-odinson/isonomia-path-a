"""WashDetector — self-dealing pattern flags (LS §9).

Statistical flags use MEDIAN/MAD, not mean/sd: a mass attack shifts the mean and
inflates the sd of the very distribution it is measured against, hiding itself;
the median holds as long as attackers are a minority of agents.

Four detectors over each epoch's settlement graph, thresholds config-tunable
(Sim Plan §2):

  circular flow        A→B→A (and A→B→C→A) value loops within the epoch
  repeat counterparty  abnormal concentration of either party's settlements in one pair
  trivial-task spam    envelope-minimum-size tasks at statistically anomalous per-agent rates
  pass-rate anomaly    high-volume pairs with implausibly perfect pass rates

Flagged settlements are unqualified pending Auditor review (LS §9) — in the sim they
stay unqualified and their volume is removed from credit-line turnover (DECISIONS #3).
False positives on honest populations are a first-class output: a detector that
flags honest trade is itself a calibration failure, so the model logs flag counts on
known-honest agents every epoch.
