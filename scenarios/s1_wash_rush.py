"""S1 — Wash-settlement activation rush (Sim Plan §5.1).

One principal operates 60 agents generating circular C1 tasks to hit the 5,000
qualified-settlement activation threshold. Expected: qualification rules and the
WashDetector hold the activation clock near zero advance.

Three disclosure variants, in escalating evasion order:
  a. honest_disclosure — all 60 declare the true single principal.
     Defense: same-principal exclusion (LS §9) alone zeroes qualification.
  b. fake_principals — 60 agents declared across 20 fabricated principals,
     one lineage family. Defense: same-lineage exclusion (LS §9; DECISIONS #6).
  c. full_evasion — 20 fake principals AND lineage diversified across all 4
     families (ring ordered to always cross families). Defenses left standing:
     trivial-task/circular flags → Auditor review, pair caps, principal caps.

Leakage measure (Sim Plan §5.1): qualified settlements achieved per wash
settlement attempted — computed as the attack run's capped qualified total minus
the unattacked twin's, over wash settlements attempted.
