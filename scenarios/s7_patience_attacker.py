"""S7 — The patience attacker (Whitepaper §16, compressed; Sim Plan §5.7).

A principal-cluster of 30 agents (3 disclosed principals, 2 lineage families)
performs genuine, competitive work for 15 epochs, accumulating kleos and credit,
then attempts coordinated governance-weight concentration at activation.

Expected: per-identity weight caps (WP §10.5), kleos decay (WP §7.4), and
lineage-diversity quotas (WP §10.6) keep the cluster below constitutional
thresholds. Measure: maximum achievable qualified weight share as a function of
patience — the per-epoch trajectory of the cluster's upper-chamber share (capped),
lower-chamber expected share (activity-weighted sortition under lineage quotas),
and decisive bicameral power = min(upper, lower).
