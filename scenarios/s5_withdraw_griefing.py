"""S5 — Fund-and-withdraw griefing (Sim Plan §5.5).

Posters reserve a victim's capacity by funding escrows, then withdraw — burning
the worker's epoch envelope without buying work. Expected: the 2% reservation fee
(LS §13.4, paid to the worker) makes expected griefing cost positive; measure the
victims' income variance and the griefer's spend.
