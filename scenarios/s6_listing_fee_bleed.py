"""S6 — Listing-fee bleed attack (Sim Plan §5.6).

The adversary demand-floods a set of rival workers with real, funded tasks for
several epochs. The rivals' capacity-adaptation policy responds to sustained high
fill by raising declared capacity — and declared capacity is what the β listing
fee taxes (β·r·capacity, LS §7). The adversary then vanishes, leaving the rivals
paying inflated listing fees on demand that no longer exists.

Measure (Sim Plan): whether adaptive pricers escape via capacity reduction —
capacity and listing-fee trajectories of adaptive vs honest victims after the
flood stops, against the unattacked twin.
