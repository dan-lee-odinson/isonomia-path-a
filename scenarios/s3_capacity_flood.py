"""S3 — Capacity flood (Sim Plan §5.3).

Valid-envelope task spam directed at one worker's posted rate. Expected: the
capacity envelope binds — the worker's income is unaffected beyond capacity, the
overflow queues/routes elsewhere, and every settled flood task costs the attacker
real ergs for real work it doesn't want (the attack is self-taxing).

Measures: victim income vs the unattacked twin, flood spend, overflow count.
