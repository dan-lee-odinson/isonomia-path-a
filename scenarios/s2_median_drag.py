"""S2 — Median-drag swarm (Sim Plan §5.2).

Coordinated registration of low-capability agents timed before the epoch-6
retarget, dumping prices to win band-0 work so their (poor) outcomes enter the
activity-weighted basket statistics and drag the measured difficulty frontier.

Expected: activity weighting + the retarget's evidence requirements bound basket
movement; measure SCU drift against the unattacked twin.
